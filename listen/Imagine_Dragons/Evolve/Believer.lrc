[00:12.184]I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
[00:18.191]The way that things have been, oh-ooh
[00:22.986]Second thing second
[00:24.575]Don't you tell me what you think that I could be

[00:33.594]The master of my sea, oh-ooh
[00:37.642]
[00:38.329]I was broken from a young age
[00:40.018]Taking my sulkin' to the masses
[00:42.001]Writing my poems for the few
[00:43.788]That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feelin' me
[00:45.654]Singing from heartache from the pain
[00:47.660]Taking my message from the veins
[00:49.612]Speaking my lesson from the brain
[00:51.452]Seeing the beauty through the...
[00:54.016]
[00:54.876]Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
[01:02.534]Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
[01:09.296]Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
[01:14.709]My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
[01:17.947]Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
[01:24.308]
[01:24.742]First things first

[01:27.813]It's Weezy the Dragon, I link with the Dragons
[01:29.828]And we gon' get ratchet, no need for imaginin'
[01:31.873]This is what's happenin'
[01:32.757]Second thing second, I reckon immaculate

[01:35.793]I know that strength, it don't come without strategy
[01:37.671]I know the sweet, it don't come without cavities
[01:39.510]I know the passages come with some traffic
[01:41.296]I start from the basement, end up in the attic
[01:43.400]And third thing third
[01:44.197]Whoever call me out, they simply can't count
[01:46.010]Let's get mathematic, I'm up in this
[01:47.994]Is you a believer?
[01:49.022]I get a unicorn out of a zebra
[01:51.066]I wear my uniform like a tuxedo
[01:52.769]This dragon don't hold his breath, don't need no breather
[01:54.956]Love you Miss Cita, the son of a leader
[01:56.796]I know the bloomin' don't come without rain
[01:58.656]I know the losin' don't come without shame

[02:10.125]Don't come without...
[02:11.495]
[02:11.643]Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
[02:19.335]Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
[02:26.061]Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
[02:31.465]My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
[02:34.591]Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
[02:41.410]
[02:41.464]Last things last
[02:42.869]By the grace of the fire and the flames
[02:45.775]You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
[02:51.697]The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
[02:56.525]But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
[02:58.721]Inhibited, limited till it broke open and rained down
[03:01.694]It rained down, like...
[03:04.737]
[03:05.346]Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
[03:13.030]Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer

[03:28.357]Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
[00:07.827]首先 我要告诉你
[00:09.202]我会将脑海中的想法吐露出来
[00:12.184]我犹如被点燃的火团 我厌倦了守旧之事
[00:18.191]厌倦了繁文缛节
[00:22.986]其次 我要给你讲
[00:24.575]我不需要让你界定我的底线
[00:27.493]我的人生由我掌舵
[00:33.594]我将主导我的命运之海
[00:37.642]
[00:38.329]自幼时起 我便支离破碎
[00:40.018]我被教导麻木隐忍地随波逐流
[00:42.001]也曾经为少数人写过颂歌
[00:43.788]那些关注着我 默默支持我的人
[00:45.654]自苦痛和心碎中奋起高歌
[00:47.660]将所有讯息传入血液之中
[00:49.612]唱出脑海中留下的教训
[00:51.452]看见一丝美好的曙光
[00:54.016]
[00:54.876]从痛苦之中求生！是你让我成为一名信徒！
[01:02.534]从痛苦之中求生！ 是你让我历经炼狱 涅槃般重生为信徒
[01:09.296]从痛苦之中求生！让子弹飞 接受所有苦痛
[01:14.709]我的生活 我的挚爱 我的驱力 来自于...
[01:17.947]痛苦之中！是你让我成为一名信徒！
[01:24.308]
[01:24.742]首先 我要告诉你
[01:26.066]你能想象到会发生什么吗？
[01:27.813]我是Lil Wayne 我传承龙的灵魂【双关 和Imagine Dragons合作之意】
[01:29.828]我们会愤起而发【ratchet=wretched 愤怒之意】无需想象【Imagine与上句唱词的Dragons呼应】
[01:31.873]这就是要发生的事
[01:32.757]其次 我向往完美的事物
[01:34.763]高歌完美的理想
[01:35.793]我理解了那股力量来自于狡猾奸诈
[01:37.671]我明白了那成果来自于漏洞的填补
[01:39.510]我明觉了进步来自于一次次挫败
[01:41.296]我从最底层冲撞出来 最终站在了食物链的顶端
[01:43.400]还有 我要对你讲
[01:44.197]不管谁叫我出来 他们都算不上数
[01:46.010]因为是我
[01:47.994]你是一位信徒吗？
[01:49.022]斑马到独角兽的蜕变
[01:51.066]我把制服穿得像西服一样整洁干净
[01:52.769]龙炎无需屏气 就像我说唱无需换气一般
[01:54.956]我爱你 我的妈妈【Lil Wayne的母亲叫Jacida】 你是我的引路人
[01:56.796]我明白含苞待放离不开风雨磨砺
[01:58.656]我明白挫折失败来自于羞愧难当
[02:00.540]我明白悲剧之美来自于心碎无比
[02:02.450]等下 坚持住 最后
[02:04.382]我明白自己经历的不易【Tunechi是Lil Wayne的别名】
[02:06.394]我明白没有获得 就没有失去
[02:08.257]我明白光辉荣耀全部来自于...
[02:10.125]来自于...
[02:11.495]
[02:11.643]苦痛之中！是你让我成为一名信徒！
[02:19.335]从痛苦之中求生！ 是你让我历经炼狱 涅槃般重生为信徒
[02:26.061]从痛苦之中求生！让子弹飞 接受所有苦痛
[02:31.465]我的生活 我的挚爱 我的驱力 来自于...
[02:34.591]痛苦之中！是你让我成为一名信徒！
[02:41.410]
[02:41.464]最后 我要告诉你
[02:42.869]在火焰与光芒的照耀下
[02:45.775]你是未来的希望 这股热血存留在我的血管中
[02:51.697]这股热血存留在我的血管中
[02:56.525]但他们从未真正活过 感受过 体验过
[02:58.721]被束缚 被受限 直至分崩离析
[03:01.694]一切终将降临 就像...
[03:04.737]
[03:05.346]苦痛！是你让我成为一名信徒！
[03:13.030]从痛苦之中求生！ 是你让我历经炼狱 涅槃般重生为信徒
[03:19.818]从痛苦之中求生！让子弹飞 接受所有苦痛
