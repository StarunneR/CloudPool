[00:12.57]痴狂，你让我疯狂，这让我疯狂
[00:23.59]寂静的夜里每一点光都在闪烁
[00:27.23]在我背上的每一根骨头都在颤抖战栗
[00:30.94]紧跟脚步，以防所有的魔法消亡
[00:35.67]因为这正让我疯狂
[00:38.45]头脑中的每一点声音都叫嚣着是是非非
[00:42.40]思想里的每一列快车都想着停停走走
[00:46.07]紧跟脚步，以防所有的魔法消亡
[00:50.71]因为这正让我疯狂
[00:53.84]你无法想到，那些游魂游走在你的视线之外
[00:57.34]揉揉眼睛，你是盛夏夜空中明亮的星
[01:01.24]这是爱，这是战争，这是神魂颠倒
[01:04.87]痴狂，你让我疯狂
[01:11.69]痴狂，你让我疯狂，这让我疯狂
[01:23.84]眼眶盈满泪水但不会掉落
[01:27.90]脊椎中的间盘无休止的颤抖
[01:31.45]紧跟脚步，以防所有的魔法消亡
[01:36.06]因为这正让我疯狂
[01:38.99]我努力紧握的双手松开让我走
[01:42.82]曾经温暖的爱留我在冰天雪地
[01:46.67]紧跟脚步，以防所有的魔法消亡
[01:51.10]因为这正让我疯狂
[01:54.15]你无法想到，那些游魂游走在你的视线之外
[01:57.80]揉揉眼睛，你是盛夏夜空中明亮的星
[02:01.57]这是爱，这是战争，这是神魂颠倒
[02:05.28]痴狂，你让我疯狂
[02:10.60]痴狂，你让我疯狂
[02:16.08]这让我疯狂
[02:18.50]你让我疯狂
[02:19.75]因为这让我疯狂
[02:24.21]你无法想到，那些游魂游走在你的视线之外
[02:28.01]揉揉眼睛，你是盛夏夜空中明亮的星
[02:31.75]这是爱，这是战争，这是神魂颠倒
[02:35.54]痴傻癫狂，神魂颠倒
[02:39.48]穿越天空，你以光速解开杂乱心结
[02:43.07]终于发现，喧闹狂乱弥漫今夜
[02:46.94]这是爱，这是战争，这是神魂颠倒
[02:50.79]痴狂，你让我疯狂
[02:56.48]这让我疯狂
