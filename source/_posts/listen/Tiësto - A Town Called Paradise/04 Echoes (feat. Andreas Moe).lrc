
[00:14.22][00:29.56][02:07.24][02:14.66][02:21.77]Your echoes
[00:16.32]Bursting of the walls into my heart
[00:22.22]Echoes
[00:23.94]Reaching me no matter where you are
[00:31.65][02:24.16]This is really
[00:32.57][02:24.97]Baby, I can’t let go
[00:35.40][02:28.16]I can’t help surrender to your echoes
[00:39.21][02:31.74]Echoes...
[02:09.13]Serving every drop into emotion
[02:16.60]Setting every sense a heavy motion
