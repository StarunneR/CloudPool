[00:03.87]If We Ever
[00:06.47]David Guetta
[00:08.45]
[00:09.64]I've been fragile for a long time
[00:16.68]A big old hole inside my heart
[00:24.29]And I was searching through the valley
[00:31.70]Stumbled on love in the dark
[00:35.14]
[00:37.92]Was afraid to try but afraid to never know
[00:45.30]What it feels like to be loved
[00:52.78]Had a hill to climb
[00:56.55]but the places we could go
[01:00.57]Oh, I gotta know
[01:05.53]
[01:07.17]So if we ever, fell in love
[01:15.22]Would the wind know, would the pain go, oh
[01:22.19]So if we ever, fell in love
[01:30.30]Oh, oh, oh
[01:34.87]
[01:39.47]I was empty it was all gone
[01:46.88]The birds would sing but made no sound
[01:54.15]Till I met you, found I was all wrong
[02:01.84]You picked me up right off the ground
[02:05.43]
[02:07.77]Was afraid to try, and afraid i'd fall again
[02:15.31]crashing down from the sky, you know
[02:22.77]Had a hill to climb, but with you I my heart will mend
[02:30.37]That's the one thing, we all wanna know
[02:35.70]
[02:37.17]So if we ever, fell in love
[02:45.21]Would the wind blow, would the pain go, oh
[02:52.27]So if we ever fell in love
[03:00.15]Oh, oh, oh
[03:04.88]
[03:08.21]I just wanna know, I just wanna know
[03:11.60]tell me tell me so, baby I just wanna know
[03:15.41]I just wanna know, I just wanna know
[03:18.94]tell me tell me so, baby I just wanna know
[03:22.83]I just wanna know, I just wanna know
[03:26.61]tell me tell me so, baby I just wanna know
[03:30.40]I just wanna know, I just wanna know
[03:34.07]tell me tell me so, baby I just wanna know
[03:37.27]So if we ever fell in love
[03:44.75]would the wind know, would the pain go, oh
[03:51.23](yeah) so if we ever fell in love
[03:59.67]Oh, oh, oh
[04:04.73]
[04:06.73]So if we ever fell in love
